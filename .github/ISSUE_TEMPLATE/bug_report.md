This is just a template to help you post a useful issue.  Erase these rules and any irrelevant categories and content as you see fit.  Do not make issues requesting compatibility with other tree providing mods such as Forestry.  Only submit issues related to the latest version of the mod for the currently supported version of Minecraft(which is currently only 1.12.2).  When referring to software versions always use the actual version number and never "latest".
